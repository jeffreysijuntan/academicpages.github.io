I am Jeffrey (Sijun) Tan, a third-year undergraduate student at University of Virginia majoring in computer science and mathematics. I am a computer vision researcher at UVa Vision Lab under the supervision of Professor Vicente Ordonez. Last summer, I worked at Facebok as a software engineering intern at the Nlp team.
